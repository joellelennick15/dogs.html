    <h1>Dogs are The Best Pets</h1>
    <p>Dogs are the best pets because they will always be there for you. They cheer you up when you're down and want to please their owners.</p>

<h2>Perfect Pets</h2>
<p>Dogs can be the perfect pet for almost anyone. They can be big or small, which can help with having a big or small living space. There can be service dogs that help a person in need of assistance in their daily life. The different breeds of dogs can have <i>very</i> different impacts on what you want in a dog. (i.e. If you want a quiet dog, then don't get a hound. If you want a calm dog, then don't get a border collie.)</p>
